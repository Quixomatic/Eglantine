# Changelog

All notable changes to this fork of Eglantine (Quixomatic/Eglantine) are documented here. Upstream's own
changes come in through merges of upstream `nx2` and are summarized per merge, not repeated in full.

Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) (`X.Y.Z`, three segments only). Each entry is
written by the `/version-bump` skill and used as its commit message body. A `vX.Y.Z` tag on the `release`
branch builds every platform and publishes a GitHub Release (see `.github/workflows/release-binaries.yml`).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-03

The first release of this fork: upstream Eglantine `nx2` (3779433f61) with the built-in MCP server, and a
release pipeline that builds from semver tags.

### Added
- **Built-in MCP server** (Model Context Protocol) so AI agents and scripts can drive and inspect the
  emulator: boot and stop games, screenshots, input and frame-exact TAS, an event timeline of logs, crashes
  and unimplemented service commands with backtraces, guest memory read/search/watch/scan, threads and
  backtraces, IPC/SVC tracing, settings, GPU-thread profiling, recorded routes with screen fingerprints,
  benchmarks and visual baselines. Off by default; loopback only; Allow Writes and an optional token gate
  state changes. Code in `src/mcp/`, docs in `docs/user/MCP.md`, `docs/MCP.md` and `tools/mcp/README.md`.
- **The emulator's debugging features from the MCP**: breakpoints and watchpoints through the GDB stub
  (hits as timeline events with registers and backtraces), shader/macro dumps, crash reports, the FS
  access log, and `ab_test` to measure what a setting changes.
- **Configure > Debug > MCP** tab for the server's settings; Tools > MCP Server menu; a status-bar label; a
  read-only browser dashboard; `eden-cli --mcp` for headless runs.

### Changed
- **Releases build from semver tags.** `release-binaries.yml` runs on `vX.Y.Z` (and `vX.Y.Z-label`
  prerelease) tags whose commit is on `release`, names the release after the tag and uses
  `.release/patch-notes/vX.Y.Z.md` or this changelog's section as its body. Pushes to `nx2` no longer
  build. The Discord ping is skipped without its webhook secret.

### Fixed
- eden-cli: `-d`/`--debug` and `-i`/`--input-profile` no longer crash on launch; TAS advances in eden-cli.
- Switch 2 module names are found, so backtraces are symbolized.
